#### My Definitions

**`Data Science:`**
- Data is `information` and Science in its fundamental form is about having a `question` and `searching` for its answer using `scientific methods`.

*Owning to that*

- Data Science is about having questions and then collecting data related to that topic and manipulating it as per ones need, exploring it using different ways to find answers to the questions which will give insights of the data collected.

  

- In simple terms if I would say then `“Data Science is working with data using scientific methods”`.

  

**`Data Scientist:`**

- Someone who uses data to find solutions to certain problems using various tools and methods, who can make use of results to `make better predictions` and `take wise decisions`. 

- Also Data Scientists is a `great storyteller`, who can create great story with the insights he/her had gained in the process of `exploring the data`.
